# Python application used to connect SQLite database using sqlite3 and PySimpleGUI libraries

## Created a database file using SQLite for students to search for internships and insert internships into the database. The database file was connected to Python code using sqlite3, and PySimpleGUI to search for internships on the database.

## Group project for Intro to Data Engineering worked along Oscar Fox.
